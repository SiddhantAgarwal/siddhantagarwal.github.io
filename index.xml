      <description>This build is great for both workstation/gaming workloads and can handle most gruelling workstation tasks or most AAA titles thrown at it 1440p at &amp;gt;60 Frame rates.
We are going with Ryzen and to address current AMD vs Intel debate, AMD Ryzen 3rd generation delivers bang for a buck performance, it handles workstation workloads better than it&amp;rsquo;s intel counterparts due to higher core/thread counts.
 Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 3.</description>

      <description>I have a huge interest in PC Gaming, since childhood have played plethora of Titles spanning various categories GTA, Assassins Creed, Crysis, Max Payne including Roller Coaster Tycoon, I still like that game.
But I never had the hardware to max out any game to ultra settings and playing all the games on ultra was on my TODO list from a long time.
So, I decided to build myself a decent gaming pc which would play all the current Titles on Ultra and the Titles of coming 2–3 Years.</description>
