<p>I have a huge interest in PC Gaming, since childhood have played plethora of Titles spanning various categories GTA, Assassins Creed, Crysis, Max Payne including Roller Coaster Tycoon, I still like that game.</p>
<p>But I never had the hardware to max out any game to ultra settings and playing all the games on ultra was on my TODO list from a long time.</p>
<p>So, I decided to build myself a decent gaming pc which would play all the current Titles on Ultra and the Titles of coming 2–3 Years.</p>
<p>Specs that I zeroed down to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Processor: Ryzen 5 1600</li>
	<li>Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-AB350-GAMING 3</li>
	<li>GPU: MSI GAMING GeForce GTX 1060 6GB</li>
	<li>RAM: HyperX FURY Black 8 GB CL15 DIMM DDR4 2400 MT/s</li>
	<li>Case: Corsair Carbide SPEC-ALPHA Mid-tower Gaming Case (Black/silver)</li>
	<li>Harddrive: WD WD10EZEX 1TB</li>
	<li>PSU: CX550 550W 80 Plus Power Supply</li>
	<li>Monitor: BenQ GW2270H 21.5 inch FHD(1080p)</li>
	<li>Mouse: Dragonwar ELE-G9 Thor BlueTrack and Blue Sensor Gaming Mouse</li>
	<li>Keyboard: Redragon ASURA K501 USB Gaming Keyboard</li>
</ul>
<p>Major reason for going with <b>Ryzen 5</b> was, compared to Intel it had much better specifications having greater Core/Thread count that its Intel i5 counterparts, plus I had the opportunity of going with something unconventional.</p>
<p>The Zen architecture is new and has already created ripples in the market. It’s a very good processor lineup AMD has given out, which is really good compared to intel.</p>
<p>On the GPU front all of them were overpriced, the <b>GTX 1060</b> that I bought was in the price range of <b>GTX 1070</b> but thanks to all the crypto miners I had to the shell out extra. But 1060 6GB would be sufficient for 1080p gaming, so I went with it.</p>
<p>I went with <b>Corsair SPEC-ALPHA</b> case as it was a mean looking case with good lighting and preinstalled fans which are more than enough to keep the machine cool(Haven’t tried overclocking it yet) and I don’t have to spend extra on fans or cooling.</p>
<p>One thing I really want to talk about is the PSU , initially I thought of going with the Corsair VS550 but then I read the reviews and came to the parts used in that were inferior so I upgraded to <b>CX550</b>, I was a little tight on the budget since then so I had to settle with the CX series. But I would suggest you go with SeaSonic PSU’s they are much better, would last you longer without any danger of frying anything.</p>
